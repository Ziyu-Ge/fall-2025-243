The project will be done in groups of three, with students assigned randomly.

The project, when split amongst the group
members, is not intended to be a huge undertaking. The goals of the
project are to give you experience in working collaboratively and
developing a well-designed, well-tested piece of software.

The project will be graded as a letter grade and will count for about as
much as two problem sets in your final grade.

Please use standard citation practices to cite any papers/code/online resources/chatbots whose ideas you make use of. Please do not consult with any people (in particular class members) who are not in your group. You are of course welcome to ask Chris or Jo√£o questions.
